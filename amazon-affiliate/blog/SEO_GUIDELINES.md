- Commercial intent (people ready to buy)
- Directly related to your products

**Example Primary Keywords by Category:**

| Personalized | "personalized gifts for her" |
| Home Decor | "palm beach style decor" |
| Organization | "amazon organization finds" |

### Step 2: Find Secondary Keywords
Support your primary keyword with 3-5 related terms.

**How to Find Secondary Keywords:**
1. Search primary keyword on Google
2. Note "People Also Ask" questions
3. Scroll to "Related Searches" at bottom
4. Use Amazon's search suggestions
5. Check "Customers Also Bought" sections

**Example:**
- Primary: "best bridesmaid gifts"
- Secondary: "bridesmaid proposal ideas," "personalized bridesmaid gifts," "bridesmaid gift boxes," "unique bridesmaid presents"

### Step 3: Add Long-Tail Keywords
