Hi [Name/Team],

I've been admiring [Brand Name]'s [specific product] for a while now, and I think it would be perfect for an upcoming piece I'm creating on [topic - e.g., "The Ultimate Bridesmaid Proposal Box Guide"].

Would you be interested in:

3. Both?

I'm happy to share examples of my previous work and discuss any specific requirements you might have.
