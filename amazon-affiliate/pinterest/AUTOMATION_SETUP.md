## Pinning Strategy

### Daily Pinning Goals

| Phase | Pins/Day | Your Content | Repins |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Launch (Week 1-4) | 5-10 | 60% | 40% |
| Growth (Month 2-3) | 10-15 | 70% | 30% |
| Scaling (Month 4+) | 15-25 | 70% | 30% |

### Content Rotation
Spread pins throughout the day across different:
- Boards (don't pin 5x to same board in a row)
- Content types (mix products, guides, inspiration)
- Categories (rotate through all 15 categories)

### Interval Pinning
Pin the same content to multiple relevant boards:
- Pin 1: Primary board (most relevant)
- Wait 7+ days
- Pin 2: Secondary board
- Wait 7+ days
- Pin 3: Third board

**Example:**
"Bridesmaid Proposal Gifts" pin goes to:
1. Day 1: Best Bridesmaid Proposal Gifts board
2. Day 8: Personalized Gift Ideas board
3. Day 15: Best Gifts Under $50 board

- Link might be broken

### Account Warnings

- Space out pins to same board

### Tailwind Issues

## Automation Rules
