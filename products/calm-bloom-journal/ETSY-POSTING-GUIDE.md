---

## Step 1: Export HTML Files to PDF

Each product file is an HTML file that you will convert to a print-ready PDF using Chrome's built-in print function. Follow each sub-step carefully -- the settings matter for print quality.

### General Instructions (applies to every file below)

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Press `Ctrl+O` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+O` (Mac) to open a file.
3. Navigate to the HTML file and open it.
4. Wait for the page to fully load (all images, fonts, and styles should be visible).
5. Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) to open the Print dialog.
6. Change **Destination** to **"Save as PDF"**.
7. Adjust settings as specified for each file below.
8. Click **"Save"** and choose your output filename.

> **IMPORTANT:** Always select **"Actual Size"** (not "Fit to Page") in the scaling options. Selecting "Fit to Page" will shrink your designs and cause sizing issues when printed.

### 1d. Wall Art -- Three Size Versions

The wall art file contains prints designed for three sizes: 8x10", 11x14", and 16x20". You need to export three separate PDFs, one for each size.

**Option A: If the HTML file has separate sections/pages per size**

Export the full file three times, each time adjusting the paper size to match:

| Output filename | Paper size | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| `Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-8x10.pdf` | Custom: 8 x 10 in | Set margins to None |
| `Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-11x14.pdf` | Custom: 11 x 14 in | Set margins to None |
| `Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-16x20.pdf` | Custom: 16 x 20 in | Set margins to None |

For each export:
1. Open `wall-art.html` in Chrome.
2. Press `Ctrl+P`.
3. Set Destination to **"Save as PDF"**.
4. Click **"More settings"**.
5. Set Paper size to the appropriate custom dimensions (see table above). If Chrome does not offer a custom size, use the closest available size or print at Letter size and note the intended print size.
6. Set Margins to **None**.
7. Check **"Background graphics"**.
8. Uncheck **"Headers and footers"**.
9. Click **Save** with the appropriate filename.

**Option B: If the HTML file contains all sizes in one continuous page**

1. Export the entire file as a single PDF at Letter size.
2. Name it `Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-AllSizes.pdf`.
3. The buyer will use the Printing Guide to select and print the correct pages at the correct size.

> **Tip:** Open the resulting PDF and check that each of the 5 art designs is present in each size. There should be 5 prints x 3 sizes = 15 total pages (or sections).

---

### 1e. Printing Guide

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Source file | `printing-guide.html` |
| Output filename | `Calm-and-Bloom-Printing-Guide.pdf` |

---

### 1f. Package Everything into ZIP Files

Etsy allows up to **5 digital files per listing**, with a **20MB maximum per file**. Organize your PDFs into ZIP archives:

**If total size is under 20MB (likely scenario):**

Create one single ZIP file:

```
Calm-and-Bloom-Complete-Bundle.zip
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-USLetter.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-A4.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Affirmation-Cards.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-8x10.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-11x14.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-16x20.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Printing-Guide.pdf
```

**How to create the ZIP:**
- **Windows:** Select all PDF files, right-click, choose "Send to" > "Compressed (zipped) folder". Rename to `Calm-and-Bloom-Complete-Bundle.zip`.
- **Mac:** Select all PDF files, right-click, choose "Compress Items". Rename to `Calm-and-Bloom-Complete-Bundle.zip`.

**If total size exceeds 20MB, split into two ZIPs:**

```
ZIP 1: Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-Bundle.zip
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-USLetter.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-A4.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Printing-Guide.pdf

ZIP 2: Calm-and-Bloom-Cards-and-Art.zip
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Affirmation-Cards.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-8x10.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-11x14.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Wall-Art-16x20.pdf
```

**For variations, also prepare these separate ZIPs:**

```
Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-Only.zip
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-USLetter.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-A4.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Printing-Guide.pdf

Calm-and-Bloom-Cards-Only.zip
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Affirmation-Cards.pdf
  |-- Calm-and-Bloom-Printing-Guide.pdf
```

> **Quality check:** Before zipping, open every PDF one final time. Scroll through every page. Confirm colors, layout, and content are correct. This is your last chance before customers download them.

---

## Step 2: Generate Listing Images with Nano Banana

You need 10 listing images. All prompts are provided in the file `nano-banana-prompts.md`. Below is a summary of each image, the naming convention, and review tips.

### Image Specifications

| Spec | Required Value |
|------|---------------|
| Dimensions | 2000 x 2000 px (1:1 square) |
| Format | JPG |
| Color profile | sRGB |
| File size | Under 1MB each |
| Resolution | 72 PPI |

### Image Generation Order

Generate each image using the corresponding prompt from `nano-banana-prompts.md`:

| # | Filename to Save As | Prompt # | Content |
|---|---------------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | `listing-image-01-hero.jpg` | Prompt 1 | Overhead flat lay of journal with eucalyptus, tea, candle |
| 2 | `listing-image-02-whats-included.jpg` | Prompt 2 | Grid layout showing all 4 bundle components |
| 3 | `listing-image-03-mood-tracker.jpg` | Prompt 3 | Close-up of journal open to mood tracker spread |
| 4 | `listing-image-04-affirmation-cards.jpg` | Prompt 4 | Affirmation cards fanned out on linen surface |
| 5 | `listing-image-05-wall-art.jpg` | Prompt 5 | Gallery wall in cozy bedroom setting |
| 6 | `listing-image-06-lifestyle.jpg` | Prompt 6 | Woman writing in journal on cozy bed |
| 7 | `listing-image-07-detail.jpg` | Prompt 7 | Macro close-up of journal typography and line art |
| 8 | `listing-image-08-anxiety-toolkit.jpg` | Prompt 8 | Open spread showing breathing guide and grounding exercise |
| 9 | `listing-image-09-bundle-value.jpg` | Prompt 9 | Bird's eye view of all bundle components spread out |
| 10 | `listing-image-10-gift.jpg` | Prompt 10 | Spiral-bound journal and ribbon-tied cards on nightstand |

### How to Generate

1. Go to Nano Banana (or your preferred AI image generation tool).
2. Copy the full prompt text from `nano-banana-prompts.md` for each image (including the Dimensions, Style, and Negative prompt lines).
3. Generate the image.
4. Download the result at 2000x2000px.
5. Save with the filename from the table above.

### Review Checklist for Each Generated Image

After generating each image, inspect it carefully before saving:

- [ ] **Dimensions correct?** Verify the image is exactly 2000 x 2000 pixels (right-click > Properties on Windows, or Get Info on Mac).
- [ ] **No text distortion?** AI-generated text on journal pages and cards often comes out garbled. If text is visible in the image, make sure it looks realistic or is artfully blurred/angled so illegibility is not obvious.
- [ ] **Color palette matches?** Colors should be soft sage green (#B8CEB3), warm cream (#FAF6F0), and dusty lavender (#C4B1CB). Reject images that are too saturated, too dark, or have a cold blue tone.
- [ ] **No AI artifacts?** Look for extra fingers on hands, warped objects, impossible shadows, floating elements, or unnatural skin textures.
- [ ] **File size under 1MB?** If the JPG is over 1MB, re-save it at slightly lower quality (90% instead of 100%) using any image editor.
- [ ] **sRGB color profile?** Most tools export sRGB by default. If you are unsure, open the image in any photo editor and confirm or convert to sRGB.

> **Tip:** The hero image (Prompt 1) is the single most important image -- it determines whether shoppers click your listing. Generate 3-5 variations and pick the best one. You can A/B test alternatives later.

> **Tip:** For images that show text on journal pages (Prompts 3, 7, 8), consider generating the base image and then overlaying real text screenshots in Canva or Photoshop for maximum quality.

---

## Step 3: Export the Listing Video

Your listing video is a 15-second product showcase animation built as an HTML file (`etsy-video.html`). You need to export it as an MP4.

### Video Specifications

| Spec | Required Value |
|------|---------------|
| Duration | 15 seconds |
| Resolution | 1080 x 1080 px (1:1 square) |
| Frame rate | 30 FPS |
| Format | MP4 (H.264 codec) |
| Audio | **None** (Etsy prohibits audio on listing videos) |
| File size | Under 100MB |

### Method A: Using the Export Script (Recommended)

If you have `ffmpeg` and headless Chrome installed, use the export script:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd /home/user/ShelzysDesigns/products/calm-bloom-journal/
   ```
3. Run the export script:
   ```
   bash scripts/export-video.sh
   ```
4. The script will render `etsy-video.html` using headless Chrome and encode the output to MP4 via ffmpeg.
5. The output file will be saved in the same directory.

> **Note:** The `scripts/` directory may not exist yet. If the script is not available, use Method B below.

### Method B: Manual Screen Recording (Quick Alternative)

If the export script is not available or you prefer a simpler approach:

1. **Open the video file:**
   - Open `etsy-video.html` in Google Chrome.
   - The animation plays automatically and loops every 15 seconds.

2. **Resize your browser window to 1080x1080:**
   - Press `F12` to open Chrome DevTools.
   - Click the **device toolbar** icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+M`).
   - Set the viewport to **1080 x 1080** pixels.
   - Close DevTools (`F12` again) or keep it open -- the viewport will stay sized.

3. **Record the screen:**
   - **Windows:** Use the built-in Xbox Game Bar (`Win+G`) or download OBS Studio (free).
   - **Mac:** Press `Cmd+Shift+5` to open the screen recording tool and select a portion of the screen.
   - **Linux:** Use OBS Studio or SimpleScreenRecorder.
   - Start recording, then refresh the page (`F5`) to trigger the animation from the beginning.
   - Record for exactly 15 seconds (watch the animation cycle).
   - Stop recording.

4. **Crop and export:**
   - Open the recording in a video editor (or use an online tool like [https://ezgif.com/crop-video](https://ezgif.com/crop-video)).
   - Crop to a perfect 1080x1080 square if needed.
   - Export as MP4, H.264 codec, no audio track.
   - Name the file `Calm-and-Bloom-Etsy-Video.mp4`.

5. **Remove any audio track:**
   - Etsy will reject videos with audio. If your screen recorder captured system audio, strip it:
   - Online: Upload to [https://www.kapwing.com/tools/mute-video](https://www.kapwing.com/tools/mute-video)
   - Command line: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -an -c:v copy output.mp4`

6. **Verify the final file:**
   - [ ] File format is MP4
   - [ ] Resolution is 1080x1080
   - [ ] Duration is approximately 15 seconds
   - [ ] No audio track
   - [ ] File size is under 100MB
   - [ ] The animation plays smoothly -- title reveals, journal pages appear, cards fan out, wall art arranges, and the CTA badges appear

## Step 4: Create the Etsy Listing

Now you have all your assets ready. Log into your Etsy seller account and go to:

**Shop Manager > Listings > Add a listing**

Direct URL: [https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/me/tools/listings/create](https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/me/tools/listings/create)

Work through every field below in the exact order Etsy presents them.

---

### Step 4a: Photos & Video

This is the first section on the listing creation page.

**Photos:**

1. Click the **first image slot** (slot 1) and upload `listing-image-01-hero.jpg`.
2. Upload the remaining 9 images in this exact order:

| Slot | File | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | `listing-image-01-hero.jpg` | Hero / Thumbnail |
| 2 | `listing-image-02-whats-included.jpg` | What's Included overview |
| 3 | `listing-image-03-mood-tracker.jpg` | Journal interior - mood tracker |
| 4 | `listing-image-04-affirmation-cards.jpg` | Affirmation cards display |
| 5 | `listing-image-05-wall-art.jpg` | Wall art room mockup |
| 6 | `listing-image-06-lifestyle.jpg` | Woman using journal |
| 7 | `listing-image-07-detail.jpg` | Close-up detail shot |
| 8 | `listing-image-08-anxiety-toolkit.jpg` | Anxiety toolkit pages |
| 9 | `listing-image-09-bundle-value.jpg` | Bundle value shot |
| 10 | `listing-image-10-gift.jpg` | Printing results / gifting |

3. After uploading, **drag to reorder** if they did not upload in the correct sequence. Image 1 (hero) must be first -- Etsy automatically uses image 1 as the thumbnail.
4. Confirm Image 1 is set as the **thumbnail** (it should be by default).

**Video:**

5. Scroll to the video upload area (below the photo slots).
6. Click **"Add a video"** and upload `Calm-and-Bloom-Etsy-Video.mp4`.
7. Wait for processing to complete. Etsy may take a few minutes to process the video.
8. Preview the video to make sure it plays correctly.

### Step 4b: Listing Details

Fill in the following fields:

**Title:**

Copy and paste this exact title into the Title field:

> This is 126 characters (under the 140-character Etsy limit). Primary keywords are front-loaded for maximum search visibility.

### Step 4c: Description

```

**Formatting tips for the Etsy description field:**

- Etsy strips Markdown, HTML, and most special formatting. What you see is what the buyer gets.
- Line breaks are preserved. Press Enter twice for a blank line between sections.
- The dashes (`---`) and brackets (`[Journal]`, `[Cards]`, etc.) serve as visual separators in plain text.
- Do not use bullet symbols like dots or arrows -- the hyphen (`-`) is the most reliable.
- After pasting, scroll through the entire description in the preview to make sure nothing got garbled.

---

### Step 4d: Tags

Etsy allows **13 tags maximum**, each up to **20 characters**. Tags are critical for search discovery -- use all 13.

Enter each tag one at a time in the Tags field. After typing each tag, press **Enter** to confirm it before typing the next one.

| # | Tag (copy exactly) | Characters |
|---|--------------------|-----------|
| 1 | `self care journal` | 17 |
| 2 | `anxiety journal` | 15 |
| 3 | `mental health planner` | 21* |
| 4 | `printable planner` | 17 |
| 5 | `wellness journal` | 16 |
| 6 | `self care printable` | 19 |
| 7 | `anxiety relief` | 14 |
| 8 | `gratitude journal` | 17 |
| 9 | `mindfulness planner` | 19 |
| 10 | `affirmation cards` | 17 |
| 11 | `self care bundle` | 16 |
| 12 | `therapy journal` | 15 |
| 13 | `digital planner` | 15 |

> *Tag #3 is 21 characters. If Etsy rejects it for exceeding the 20-character limit, use `mental health plan` (18 characters) instead.

**After entering all tags:**
- Count them. You should see exactly 13 tags.
- Double-check for typos -- Etsy matches tags exactly to search queries.

---

### Step 4e: Digital Files

Since you selected "Digital" as the listing type, Etsy will show a **Digital files** section. This is where buyers' downloads come from.

**Etsy allows up to 5 digital files per listing, with a maximum of 20MB per file.**

**For the Full Bundle (default listing):**

Upload these files:

| # | File to Upload | Contents |
|---|---------------|----------|
| 1 | `Calm-and-Bloom-Complete-Bundle.zip` | All 7 PDFs (journal US Letter + A4, affirmation cards, 3 wall art sizes, printing guide) |

If the single ZIP exceeds 20MB, split and upload two files:

| # | File to Upload | Contents |
|---|---------------|----------|
| 1 | `Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-Bundle.zip` | Both journal PDFs + printing guide |
| 2 | `Calm-and-Bloom-Cards-and-Art.zip` | Affirmation cards + all wall art PDFs |

**Upload steps:**

1. Click **"Upload a file"** in the Digital files section.
2. Select your ZIP file(s).
3. Wait for the upload to complete (a progress bar will show).
4. After upload, Etsy will display the filename and file size. Verify it matches your file.
5. If uploading multiple files, click "Upload a file" again for each additional file.

> **Important:** After uploading, click the **download** icon next to each file to test-download it yourself. Open the downloaded ZIP on your computer and verify all PDFs are inside and open correctly. This is exactly what your customer will receive.

---

### Step 4f: Pricing & Variations

**Base Price:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Price | `12.97` |
| Compare-at price (Original price) | `19.97` |
| Quantity | `999` |
| SKU | `CALM-BLOOM-JOURNAL-V1` |

> The compare-at price creates a "35% off" badge on your listing. Etsy will show the $19.97 price crossed out next to your $12.97 selling price.

> For digital products, set quantity to **999** (effectively unlimited). Etsy decrements the count with each sale but does not actually limit downloads.

**Setting Up Variations:**

Variations allow you to sell different versions (Full Bundle, Journal Only, Cards Only) at different prices within a single listing.

1. Scroll to the **Variations** section.
2. Click **"Add variations"**.
3. For the variation type, select **"Title"** (or "Primary color" / create a custom variation name -- whatever Etsy offers). Choose whichever option lets you create named options. Some sellers use "Style" or "Format" as the variation name.
4. Enter the variation name: **Bundle Option** (or simply use the default variation name Etsy provides).
5. Add three options:

**Variation 1: Full Bundle**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Option name | `Full Bundle (Journal + Cards + Art + Guide)` |
| Price | `12.97` |
| SKU | `CALM-BLOOM-FULL` |
| Digital files | Upload `Calm-and-Bloom-Complete-Bundle.zip` (or both split ZIPs) |

**Variation 2: Journal Only**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Option name | `Journal Only` |
| Price | `8.97` |
| SKU | `CALM-BLOOM-JOURNAL` |
| Digital files | Upload `Calm-and-Bloom-Journal-Only.zip` |

**Variation 3: Affirmation Cards Only**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Option name | `Affirmation Cards Only` |
| Price | `4.97` |
| SKU | `CALM-BLOOM-CARDS` |
| Digital files | Upload `Calm-and-Bloom-Cards-Only.zip` |

6. For each variation, Etsy will let you assign specific digital files. Make sure each variation has the correct ZIP assigned.
7. Set the **Full Bundle** as the default selection (it should be the first option).
8. Click **"Save variations"** or continue to the next section.

> **Note on pricing psychology:** The Full Bundle at $12.97 is only $4 more than Journal Only ($8.97). This anchoring makes the bundle feel like a great deal and encourages buyers to choose it over the individual options.

### Step 4g: Settings

Fill in the remaining listing settings:

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Processing time | **Instant download** | This should be automatic for digital listings |
| Renewal option | **Automatic** | Etsy will auto-renew the listing after each sale ($0.20 fee per renewal) |
| Quantity | **999** | Effectively unlimited for digital products |
| SKU | `CALM-BLOOM-JOURNAL-V1` | Internal reference code |

**Shop section:**

- If you have a shop section called "Printable Journals & Planners" (or similar), select it.
- If you do not have a relevant section yet, create one: go to Shop Manager > Listings > Sections > Add Section > name it "Printable Journals & Planners".

**Production partner:**

- Select **No** (you made this yourself, no production partner).

**Personalization:**

- Leave **OFF** (this is a standard digital download, not a personalized product).

## Step 5: SEO Optimization Check

Before clicking Publish, run through this final checklist to maximize your listing's search visibility:

- [ ] **Title starts with primary keyword:** The title begins with "Self Care Journal Printable" -- this is correct. Do not rearrange it.
- [ ] **All 13 tags entered:** Go back to the Tags section and count. There should be exactly 13 tags.
- [ ] **Description first 160 characters are keyword-rich:** The description opens with "CALM & BLOOM -- Self-Care & Anxiety Relief Journal Bundle" followed by keywords. This text appears in Etsy search results and Google Shopping snippets.
- [ ] **All 10 image slots filled:** Scroll to the Photos section and count. Every slot from 1-10 should have an image.
- [ ] **Video uploaded:** Confirm the video shows in the listing preview.
- [ ] **Digital files uploaded and tested:**
  - [ ] Click the download icon on each uploaded file.
  - [ ] Open the downloaded ZIP.
  - [ ] Open every PDF inside the ZIP.
  - [ ] Confirm pages look correct, fonts render properly, colors are right.
- [ ] **Price is $12.97 with compare-at $19.97:** Verify in the Pricing section.
- [ ] **All 3 variations are configured:** Full Bundle ($12.97), Journal Only ($8.97), Cards Only ($4.97).
- [ ] **Each variation has the correct digital file(s) assigned.**
- [ ] **Category is Paper & Party Supplies > Paper > Journals & Planners.**
- [ ] **Listing type is Digital (not Physical).**
- [ ] **Auto-renewal is ON.**
- [ ] **SKU is CALM-BLOOM-JOURNAL-V1.**

> If anything is missing or incorrect, fix it now. Once you publish, the first 48 hours of visibility are the most valuable -- you do not want to waste them fixing errors.

## Step 6: Publish & Post-Launch

### Publishing

1. Scroll to the bottom of the listing creation page.
2. Review the listing preview one final time.
3. Click **"Publish"**.
4. Etsy will charge a **$0.20 listing fee** for publishing.
5. Your listing is now live. Etsy will provide a link to your published listing.

### Immediate Post-Launch Tasks (do these within the first hour)

**Test the listing as a buyer:**

1. Open your listing URL in an incognito/private browser window.
2. Verify:
   - [ ] All 10 images display correctly and are in the right order.
   - [ ] The video plays and looks good.
   - [ ] The title, description, and price display correctly.
   - [ ] The variations (Full Bundle, Journal Only, Cards Only) are selectable with correct prices.
   - [ ] The "Digital download" badge appears.

**Test purchase (recommended):**

3. Ask a friend or use a second Etsy account to make a test purchase.
4. After "purchasing," verify:
   - [ ] The download link is delivered immediately.
   - [ ] The ZIP file downloads correctly.
   - [ ] All PDFs inside the ZIP open properly.
   - [ ] Each variation delivers the correct set of files.

**Mobile check:**

5. Open the listing on your phone (or use Chrome DevTools mobile emulation).
6. Verify:
   - [ ] Images look good on a small screen.
   - [ ] Description is readable and not cut off awkwardly.
   - [ ] The "Add to cart" button is easy to find.
   - [ ] Variation selector works on mobile.

### First 48 Hours: The Visibility Window

Etsy gives new listings a temporary visibility boost in search results for the first 48 hours. Maximize this window:

- **Share on social media immediately** (see Step 7 for details).
- **Do not edit the listing** during the first 48 hours unless you find a critical error. Frequent edits can reset the new listing boost.
- **Monitor your Etsy Stats** (Shop Manager > Stats) to watch for:
  - Views (how many people see your listing)
  - Favorites (how many people save it)
  - Visits (how many people click into the full listing)
  - Conversion rate (percentage of visitors who buy)
- **Respond to any messages within 1 hour.** Quick response times improve your shop's reputation and can influence Etsy search ranking.

## Step 7: Promote the Listing

### Pinterest (Highest Priority for This Product Type)

Pinterest is the single best free traffic source for printable journal products. Create 5-10 pins:

1. Go to [https://www.pinterest.com/pin-creation-tool/](https://www.pinterest.com/pin-creation-tool/) (or use Canva to design pins first).
2. Use your listing images as pin images (the 2000x2000 images work, but vertical 1000x1500 pins perform best -- consider cropping or creating dedicated pin graphics in Canva).
3. For each pin:
   - **Title:** Include keywords like "Self Care Journal Printable" or "Anxiety Relief Journal Bundle."
   - **Description:** Write 2-3 sentences with keywords. Example: "Beautiful 60-page printable self-care journal for anxiety relief. Includes mood tracker, gratitude prompts, 30 affirmation cards, and 5 wall art prints. Instant digital download -- print at home!"
   - **Link:** Paste your Etsy listing URL.
   - **Board:** Pin to a board named something like "Printable Planners & Journals" or "Self-Care Essentials."
4. Space pins out over 1-2 weeks (do not post all 10 at once -- Pinterest favors consistent posting).
5. Apply to join relevant group boards for more reach.

### Instagram

1. **Post a Reel or carousel** using your best 3-5 listing images.
2. **Stories:** Share a behind-the-scenes story of creating the journal. Use the link sticker to link directly to the Etsy listing.
3. **Hashtags:** Use hashtags like `#selfcarejournal`, `#anxietyrelief`, `#printableplanner`, `#digitaldownload`, `#mentalhealthjournal`, `#journaling`, `#etsyshop`, `#printablejournal`.
4. **Bio link:** Update your Instagram bio link to include the Etsy listing URL (use Linktree if you have multiple links).

### Etsy Teams

1. In your Etsy account, go to **Community > Teams**.
2. Search for and join relevant teams:
   - "Digital Downloads Sellers"
   - "Printable Planner Shops"
   - "Self-Care & Wellness Products"
   - "New Etsy Sellers Support"
3. Participate genuinely (do not just spam your listing). Comment on others' work, share tips, and mention your listing when relevant.

### Etsy Ads (Optional -- Paid Promotion)

1. Go to **Shop Manager > Marketing > Etsy Ads**.
2. Set a daily budget of **$1 to $5** to start. You can increase this later if you see positive ROI.
3. Etsy will automatically promote your listing in search results and on listing pages.
4. Monitor performance after 7 days:
   - If cost-per-click is under $0.30 and you are getting sales, increase the budget.
   - If you spend $20 with no sales, pause ads and review your listing images and pricing.
5. Etsy Ads work best when your listing already has a few sales and reviews (social proof), so consider starting ads after your first 3-5 organic sales.

### Additional Promotion Ideas

- **Email list:** If you have an email list, send an announcement with a direct link.
- **Facebook Groups:** Share in groups related to self-care, journaling, and printable planning (check group rules first).
- **TikTok:** Create a short video showing the journal pages, printing process, or a "pack an order with me" style video.
- **Blog post:** If you have a blog, write a post about self-care journaling and link to the Etsy listing.

## Troubleshooting FAQ

### "My PDF is too large for Etsy (over 20MB)"

**Solutions:**

1. **Compress the PDF online:** Use [https://www.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf](https://www.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf) or [https://smallpdf.com/compress-pdf](https://smallpdf.com/compress-pdf). These tools can reduce file size by 50-80% with minimal quality loss. Choose "medium" compression.
2. **Reduce image quality in the PDF:** If the HTML file contains large embedded images, re-export the PDF from Chrome using the "Save as PDF" method and see if the result is smaller.
3. **Split into multiple ZIP files:** Etsy allows up to 5 files per listing. Split your bundle into two ZIPs as described in Step 1f.
4. **Re-export with lower DPI:** In Chrome's print dialog, the default export is 300 DPI. Some content may work fine at 150 DPI. Re-export and compare quality.

### "The listing images look blurry on Etsy"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check dimensions:** Images must be at least **2000 x 2000 pixels**. Right-click > Properties (Windows) or Get Info (Mac) to verify. Anything smaller will appear blurry when Etsy scales them up.
2. **Check file format:** Use JPG (not PNG). Etsy compresses PNGs in ways that can reduce quality.
3. **Regenerate at higher resolution:** If Nano Banana output was lower resolution, regenerate with explicit "2000x2000" in the prompt or upscale using [https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image).
4. **Avoid over-compression:** If you manually compressed the JPG to get it under 1MB, try 90% quality instead of 80%.

### "I can't upload the video to Etsy"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check the format:** Etsy only accepts **MP4** files. Convert if needed: [https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-converter](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-converter).
2. **Check the file size:** Must be **under 100MB**. If larger, re-export at lower bitrate or shorter duration.
3. **Remove the audio track:** Etsy prohibits audio in listing videos. Use `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -an -c:v copy output.mp4` or an online tool like [https://www.kapwing.com/tools/mute-video](https://www.kapwing.com/tools/mute-video).
4. **Check the resolution:** Should be **1080 x 1080** (square). If it is a different aspect ratio, crop it using a video editor.
5. **Try a different browser:** If the upload fails repeatedly, try uploading from Chrome (not Safari or Firefox) as Etsy's upload tool works best in Chrome.

### "Etsy rejected my listing"

**Common reasons and fixes:**

| Reason | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Intellectual property violation | Remove any copyrighted imagery, brand names, or trademarked phrases from your images and description. |
| Misleading "digital vs. physical" | Make sure the listing type is set to **Digital** and the description clearly states "This is a DIGITAL DOWNLOAD. No physical product will be shipped." |
| Prohibited content in images | Etsy may flag AI-generated images that look like real photographs of people. If Image 6 (lifestyle photo) is flagged, replace it with a flat lay or mockup instead. |
| Too many keywords / keyword stuffing | If Etsy flags the title or tags, reduce repetition. Each tag should target a unique keyword phrase. |
| Missing required fields | Go back through the listing and fill in every required field -- especially Category, Type, and "Who made it." |
| Price too low | Etsy occasionally flags listings priced under $1. At $4.97 (Cards Only variation), you should be fine, but if flagged, raise the minimum variation to $5.00. |

### "My listing is not showing up in Etsy search"

**This is normal for the first 24-48 hours.** Etsy's search index can take time to include new listings. If your listing is still not appearing after 48 hours:

1. Verify the listing status is **Active** (Shop Manager > Listings).
2. Search for your exact title -- it should appear. If not, there may be an indexing delay.
3. Search for individual tags to see if the listing ranks.
4. Make sure you used all 13 tags and your title contains your primary keywords.
5. Do not repeatedly edit and re-publish the listing -- this can reset search ranking.

### "How do I update the listing after publishing?"

1. Go to **Shop Manager > Listings**.
2. Click on the listing title to open it for editing.
3. Make your changes.
4. Click **"Publish"** again (or "Save as draft" if you are not ready to go live).
5. Avoid editing more than once per week unless necessary -- frequent edits can temporarily reduce search visibility.
