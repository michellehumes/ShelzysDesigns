### Printing Recommendations

- **Paper:** 28-32lb (105-120gsm) bright white for the journal; 65-80lb cardstock for affirmation cards
- **Settings:** Select "Actual Size" (NOT "Fit to Page"), highest quality print setting
- **Color:** Full color recommended, but the ink-efficient design works beautifully in grayscale too
- **Binding:** We love spiral binding at a local print shop ($3-5) or a simple 3-ring binder
