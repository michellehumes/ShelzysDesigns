## Post-Generation Notes

- After generating each image, review for: realistic paper textures, accurate color palette matching, no garbled or AI-looking text, natural lighting consistency
- Images 3, 4, 7, and 8 will likely need the most iteration due to text/typography on journal pages — consider using images where text is slightly out of focus or at angles that don't require readable text
- For images that show text on pages (prompts 3, 4, 7, 8), you may want to generate the base image and then overlay real text/mockup screenshots in Canva or Photoshop for maximum quality
- Hero image (Prompt 1) is the most critical — generate multiple variations and A/B test
- Consider adding text overlays in Canva after generation for images 2 (labels) and 9 (value callouts like "60+ Pages!" or "$19.97 Value")
