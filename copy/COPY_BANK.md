### "Why Sublimation?" Section

**Section Title:**
```
Why Our Bottles Don't Peel, Crack, or Fade
```

**Body Copy:**
```
Most personalized bottles use vinyl decals that eventually peel, crack, or fade. At Shelzy's Designs, every name and design is created with true sublimation printing—the ink is infused directly into the bottle's coating.

That means:
• No raised edges
• No peeling
• No cracking
• No fading
• A smooth, permanent finish

Your personalization becomes part of the bottle itself.

## ABOUT PAGE

**Page Title:**
```
About Shelzy's Designs
```

**Headline:**
```
Made With Care, One Bottle at a Time
```

**Body Copy:**
```
Shelzy's Designs was created around one simple idea: personalized gifts should feel special, not cheap. Every bottle is designed, sublimated, and packed with care so that when it arrives at your door, it feels like a gift—even if it's for yourself.

We don't use vinyl stickers or quick shortcuts. Your name is permanently infused into the bottle with high-quality sublimation printing for a smooth, long-lasting finish that looks as beautiful as the moment you unbox it.

What started as a passion for beautiful, functional design has grown into a business built on quality, attention to detail, and the belief that personalized gifts should last.

Whether you're a bride looking for the perfect bridesmaid proposal, a mom ordering bottles for your kids, or someone treating yourself to something special—we're here to create something you'll love.

Thank you for supporting Shelzy's Designs. Every order means the world to us.
```

**Optional "Our Process" Section:**

**Headline:**
```
How We Make Every Bottle
```

**Body:**
```
1. You place your order with your custom details
2. We design your personalization layout for perfect balance and spacing
3. Your design is printed onto special sublimation paper
4. The bottle is heated, and the ink is infused into the coating (this is sublimation!)
5. We inspect every bottle for quality
6. Your bottle is carefully packaged and shipped

The result? A smooth, permanent finish that's part of the bottle—not stuck onto it.

## HOW IT WORKS PAGE

**Page Title:**
```
How It Works
```

**Intro Copy:**
```
Ordering a personalized bottle from Shelzy's Designs is simple. Here's how it works from start to finish.
```

**Step 1:**
**Title:** Choose Your Bottle
**Body:**
```
Browse our collections and pick your favorite bottle color and style. Whether you're shopping for a bridesmaid gift, a birthday present, or yourself—we've got options for every occasion.
```

**Step 2:**
**Title:** Add Your Personalization
**Body:**
```
Enter the name exactly as you'd like it to appear. Choose your font style, text color, and any optional icons or design details. Don't worry—we'll make sure it looks perfectly balanced and beautifully centered.
```

**Step 3:**
**Title:** We Sublimate, Pack, and Ship
**Body:**
```
Once you place your order, we get to work. Your design is printed using high-quality sublimation inks and heat-pressed directly into the bottle's coating (no vinyl stickers!). Each bottle is carefully inspected, beautifully packaged, and shipped to your door.

Processing time: 3–5 business days
Shipping time: 3–7 business days

Rush orders? Contact us before placing your order.
```

**What is Sublimation?**
**Body:**
```
Sublimation is a printing process where ink is infused directly into the bottle's coating using heat and pressure. Unlike vinyl decals that sit on top of the surface (and eventually peel or crack), sublimation becomes part of the bottle itself.

The result:
• Smooth finish with no raised edges
• Won't peel, crack, or fade
• Dishwasher-safe (though we recommend hand washing for longevity)
• Looks professional and lasts for years
```

## FAQ PAGE

**Page Title:**
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

### General Questions

**Q: Is the personalization vinyl?**
```
A: No. All designs are created with true sublimation printing, which is permanent and won't peel or crack. The ink is infused directly into the bottle's coating, so your personalization becomes part of the bottle itself.
```

**Q: Will the design peel or fade?**
```
A: No. Unlike vinyl decals, sublimation printing is permanent. The ink is heat-pressed into the bottle's coating, so it won't peel, crack, or fade over time.
```

**Q: Are the bottles dishwasher safe?**
```
A: We recommend hand washing to keep the finish looking its best for years. However, sublimation is far more durable than vinyl and won't peel in normal use. Many customers do put them in the dishwasher without issues, but hand washing ensures longevity.
```

**Q: How long do the bottles keep drinks cold or hot?**
```
A: Our 20oz double-wall insulated bottles keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours.
```

**Q: Are the bottles BPA-free?**
```
A: Yes! All bottles are made from BPA-free stainless steel.

### Email 2: Why Sublimation Matters

**Subject Line:**
```
Why Our Bottles Don't Peel (And Why That Matters)
```

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Ever ordered a "personalized" water bottle only to have the vinyl sticker start peeling after a few weeks?

Yeah, we've been there too. That's why we do things differently.

At Shelzy's Designs, we use sublimation printing—a process where the ink is heat-pressed directly into the bottle's coating. No stickers. No raised edges. Just a smooth, permanent finish that lasts.

Here's what that means for you:
✅ No peeling or cracking
✅ Smooth, professional finish
✅ Dishwasher-friendly (though we recommend hand washing)
✅ Looks as good a year from now as it does on day one

If you're tired of cheap personalization, you're in the right place.
