## Brand Differentiation

### What Makes Shelzy's Different

**Sublimation vs. Vinyl**
- Most competitors use **vinyl decals** that peel, crack, and fade
- Shelzy's uses **true sublimation printing** – ink is infused into the coating
- Result: Smooth, permanent, professional finish

**Premium Positioning**
- Not the cheapest option
- Quality over quantity
- Beautiful packaging (gift-ready)
- Bundles and thoughtful add-ons

**Specialization**
- Focus on **weddings & bridal parties** as hero use case
- Expertise in personalization layout and design
- Fast turnaround with white-glove service

---

## Brand Personality

If Shelzy's Designs were a person, she would be:
- Thoughtful and detail-oriented
- Confident but not flashy
- Warm and approachable
- Quality-obsessed
- Organized and reliable
- Slightly preppy/coastal aesthetic

---

## Competitive Positioning

### We Are NOT:
- A mass-market Etsy shop with vinyl stickers
- A discount bulk supplier
- A trendy fast-fashion brand

### We ARE:
- A premium personalization brand
- A specialist in sublimation quality
- A go-to for brides and thoughtful gift-givers
- A brand people discover and recommend
