      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Sublimation printing uses heat to infuse ink directly into the bottle's coating, making the design permanent. Unlike vinyl decals that sit on top of the surface and can peel, crack, or fade, sublimation creates a smooth finish that's dishwasher safe and won't deteriorate over time."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes! Because we use sublimation printing (not vinyl), your personalized design is completely dishwasher safe. We recommend the top rack for best results, though hand washing extends the life of any drinkware."
