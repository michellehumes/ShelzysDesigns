**Current Site:** shelzysdesigns.com
**Audit Date:** November 21, 2025
**Goal:** Increase conversions and revenue

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Today)

### 1. **MISSING CORE PAGES (404 Errors)**
**Problem:** About page, individual product pages are returning 404 errors
**Impact:** Loss of trust, SEO penalties, unable to view product details
**Fix Today:**
- Create/restore About page using `/copy/COPY_BANK.md` content
- Fix product page URLs or create pages for all 10 products
- Add FAQ page (critical for trust + conversions)
- Add "How It Works" page

**Revenue Impact:** +15-20% conversion rate (customers need these pages to trust you)

---

### 2. **WEAK PRODUCT CATALOG**
**Problem:** Only 10 products, 3 are out of stock, 2 are off-brand (Canva templates)
**Current Products:**
- 5 wedding bottle sets
- 1 single bottle
- 1 premium bottle with box
- 2 Canva templates (??)
- 1 corporate bulk set (sold out)

**What's Missing from YOUR Brand Guide:**
- Bridesmaid Proposal Gift Box (your hero product!)
- Kids Personalized Bottles
- Holiday Collection
- Everyday Custom Bottle variations
- Individual bridesmaid bottles

**Fix Today:**
1. **Import the 7 products from your CSV** (`/shopify/PRODUCTS_IMPORT.csv`)
2. **Remove Canva templates** (off-brand, confusing)
3. **Restock or remove sold-out items**

**Revenue Impact:** +30-50% (more products = more sales opportunities)

---

### 3. **NO SUBLIMATION MESSAGING**
**Problem:** Your #1 differentiator (sublimation vs vinyl) is NOT mentioned on homepage
**Current:** Generic "personalized water bottles"
**Should Be:** "Premium SUBLIMATION water bottles - no vinyl, no peeling, permanent finish"

**Fix Today:**
- Add "Why Sublimation" section to homepage (we built this!)
- Update product descriptions to emphasize sublimation
- Add comparison: Shelzy's (sublimation) vs Competition (vinyl)

**Revenue Impact:** +20-25% (clear differentiation increases willingness to pay premium)

---

## 🟡 HIGH-PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS (This Week)

### 4. **HOMEPAGE LACKS STRUCTURE**
**Current:** Basic slideshow, some products, scattered info
**Missing:**
- Clear hero with value prop
- Why Sublimation section
- How It Works (3 steps)
- Email capture with incentive
- Trust badges

**Fix This Week:**
Deploy the custom sections we built:
- Shelzy Hero (clear value prop)
- Why Sublimation (differentiation)
- How It Works (reduces friction)
- Email Signup (list building)

**Revenue Impact:** +10-15% conversion rate

---

### 5. **NO VISIBLE PRODUCT REVIEWS**
**Problem:** Homepage claims "500+ 5-Star Reviews" but NO reviews visible
**Fix This Week:**
- Install Judge.me or Yotpo (free plans available)
- Import/collect real reviews
- Display on product pages
- Feature best reviews on homepage

**Revenue Impact:** +25-35% (reviews are proven to increase conversions)

---

### 6. **PRICING CONFUSION**
**Current Pricing Issues:**
- Single bottle: $24.99
- Premium bottle with box: $34.99 (only $10 more)
- Set of 3: $59.99 ($20/bottle)
- Set of 5: $99 ($19.80/bottle)
- Set of 10: $187.43 ($18.74/bottle)

**Problems:**
- Not enough incentive for bulk (only $6 discount from single to 10-pack per bottle)
- "Premium with box" should be positioned higher (it's your hero product!)
- No clear "best value" badge

**Fix This Week:**
- **Increase single bottle price:** $32-34 (establishes premium positioning)
- **Keep premium box at $34.99** (makes it the obvious best value for singles)
- **Increase bulk discounts:** 15% off 5-pack, 20% off 10-pack
- Add "BEST VALUE" badges

**Revenue Impact:** +15-20% average order value

---

### 7. **WEAK BRIDAL POSITIONING**
**Problem:** You have 5 bridal products but no dedicated bridal landing page
**Current:** Just a collection page with products

**Fix This Week:**
Create dedicated bridal landing page with:
- Hero: "The Ultimate Bridesmaid Proposal"
- Emotional storytelling (use copy bank content)
- Proposal Gift Box showcase
- Testimonials from brides
- "Why bridesmaids love these bottles" section
- Clear CTA to proposal box

**Why:** Bridal = your highest AOV + highest emotion = highest conversion

**Revenue Impact:** +20-30% on bridal products (your main category)

---

## 🟢 MEDIUM-PRIORITY (Next 2 Weeks)

### 8. **ADD UPSELLS & BUNDLES**
**Current:** No cross-sells, no bundle suggestions
**Add:**
- "Frequently bought together" on product pages
- "Complete your set" upsells
- "Add gift wrapping" (+$5)
- "Rush processing" (+$15)

**Revenue Impact:** +10-15% average order value

---

### 9. **EMAIL CAPTURE & AUTOMATION**
**Current:** No visible email capture
**Add:**
- Exit-intent popup (10% off first order)
- Email signup footer
- Abandoned cart emails (installed in Klaviyo)
- Post-purchase "review request" emails

**Revenue Impact:** +20% from abandoned cart recovery alone

---

### 10. **MOBILE OPTIMIZATION**
**Current:** Seems responsive but needs testing
**Test & Fix:**
- Form fields on mobile (personalization)
- Image loading speed
- Checkout flow
- Touch targets (buttons need to be 44px minimum)

**Revenue Impact:** +10-15% (50%+ of traffic is mobile)

---

### 11. **ADD LIVE CHAT**
**Why:** Personalized products = questions
**Solution:** Tidio or Gorgias (free plans)
**Impact:** Capture customers with questions before they leave

**Revenue Impact:** +5-10%
