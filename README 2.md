## ✍️ Website Copy

### Copy Documents

### Copy Highlights

**Homepage Hero:**
> Premium Personalized Sublimation Water Bottles
> Custom-made bottles for bridesmaids, weddings, holidays, and every day in between.

**Why Sublimation:**
> Most personalized bottles use vinyl decals that eventually peel, crack, or fade. At Shelzy's Designs, every name and design is created with true sublimation printing—the ink is infused directly into the bottle's coating.

**About Shelzy's:**
> Made With Care, One Bottle at a Time
> Shelzy's Designs was created around one simple idea: personalized gifts should feel special, not cheap.

**All copy is:**
- Copy-paste ready
- SEO-optimized
- Conversion-focused
- Brand-aligned
