# Reviews & Social Proof Strategy

Reviews are essential for Amazon conversion. Products with **15+ reviews** see significantly higher conversion rates. This guide covers ethical, Amazon-compliant methods to build your review base.

---

## Why Reviews Matter

| Review Count | Impact on Conversion |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 0 reviews | Significant conversion barrier |
| 1-14 reviews | Building credibility |
| 15-30 reviews | Competitive threshold |
| 50+ reviews | Strong social proof |
| 100+ reviews | Category leader status |

### Current State
- **Clear Plastic Bottle:** Needs review audit
- **Stainless Steel Bottle:** Needs review audit
- **Blank Tumbler:** Needs review audit

**Goal:** 15-30 reviews across products within 90 days

## 1. Amazon Vine Program

Amazon Vine is the **fastest legitimate way** to get initial reviews. Verified reviewers receive free products and must provide honest feedback.

### Requirements
- Must be Brand Registered
- Product must have fewer than 30 reviews
- Product must be in "new" condition
- Must have available inventory

### How to Enroll
1. Go to **Seller Central > Brands > Vine**
2. Select eligible products
3. Provide inventory for reviewers (0-30 units recommended)
4. Wait for reviews (typically 2-4 weeks)

### Vine Costs
| Enrollment Fee | Product Cost |
|----------------|--------------|
| $200 per parent ASIN (first enrollment free) | Your cost of goods for units sent |

### Best Practices
- Enroll when listing is fully optimized
- Start with your best-performing product
- Budget for 5-10 units per product
- Expect honest reviews (both positive and constructive)

## 2. Request a Review Button

Amazon's built-in "Request a Review" button sends an official email asking for both product review and seller feedback.

### How to Use
1. Go to **Seller Central > Orders > Manage Orders**
2. Find completed orders (5-30 days after delivery)
3. Click "Request a Review" button
4. Confirm the request

### Timing Guidelines
| Days After Delivery | Recommendation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 0-4 days | Too early - customer hasn't used product |
| 5-14 days | Optimal window |
| 15-30 days | Still effective |
| 30+ days | Amazon doesn't allow requests |

### Automation Options
- Use Amazon's Buyer-Seller Messaging automation
- Third-party tools like FeedbackWhiz, Jungle Scout
- Manual process for low-volume sellers

### Request a Review Checklist
- [ ] Wait minimum 5 days after delivery
- [ ] Check order was delivered successfully
- [ ] Do NOT request from orders with returns/issues
