# Listing Optimization Strategy

Your listings are the foundation of Amazon success. This guide covers every element that needs optimization to compete effectively and convert browsers into buyers.

## 1. Product Title Optimization

### Current Title (Needs Improvement)
```
Shelzy's Designs Personalized Island Love Water Bottles, 25oz, White Stainless
Steel or Clear BPA Free Plastic, Flip Top Straw, Customizable
```

### Current Issues
| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Missing high-volume keywords | "custom name," "personalized gift," "bridesmaid" not included |
| "Island Love" is brand-specific | Not a search term customers use |
| Not mobile-optimized | First 80 characters most visible on mobile |

### Recommended Title Structure
```
Shelzy's Designs Personalized Water Bottle with Name - 25oz Custom Tumbler
for Bridesmaid Gift, Bachelorette Party Favors - Stainless Steel Insulated,
BPA Free - Wedding Bridal Shower Gift for Women
```

### Title Optimization Best Practices

1. **Front-load primary keywords** - Most important terms in first 80 characters for mobile visibility
2. **Include use-case keywords** - Bridesmaid, bachelorette, wedding, bridal shower, corporate gift
3. **Add benefit words** - Insulated, leak-proof, customizable
4. **Use proper capitalization** - Capitalize first letter of each word except prepositions

### Title Formula
```
[Brand] [Primary Keyword] [Differentiator] - [Size/Specs] [Use Case 1],
[Use Case 2] - [Material Benefits] - [Gift Occasion]
```
