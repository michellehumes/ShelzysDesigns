## Differentiation: Seller vs. Affiliate

This directory (`amazon-seller/`) focuses on **selling your own products** through Amazon Seller Central, which is separate from the affiliate marketing strategy in `amazon-affiliate/`:

| Amazon Seller Central | Amazon Associates (Affiliate) |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Sell YOUR products | Promote OTHER products |
| FBA/FBM fulfillment | Link sharing for commission |
| Inventory management | Content creation |
| Brand building | Traffic generation |

Both strategies complement each other and can cross-promote.
