## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Theme Doesn't Look Right

**Problem:** Site looks broken or unstyled

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Appearance → Themes**
2. Make sure **"ShelzyPerkins Affiliate Theme"** is activated
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Import Button Doesn't Work

**Problem:** Nothing happens when clicking "Import Now"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure theme is activated FIRST
2. Try deactivating and reactivating the plugin
3. Check that you're logged in as an administrator

### Content Already Exists Message

**Problem:** Import says content already exists

**Solution:** This is normal! The plugin skips existing content. If you want to re-import, delete the old content first.

### Amazon Links Don't Have Affiliate Tag

**Problem:** Clicked links don't show `tag=shelzysdesigns-20`

**Solution:** The theme adds this automatically. Make sure:
1. ShelzyPerkins theme is activated
2. You're using regular amazon.com URLs in content
3. Clear your browser cache
