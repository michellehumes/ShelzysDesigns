============================================================
FIX THE "500+ REVIEWS" CLAIM - IMPORTANT!
============================================================

PROBLEM:
Your header says "4.9★ • 500+ 5-Star Reviews" but there are
NO actual reviews displayed anywhere on your site. This is:
1. A trust killer when customers look for reviews and find none
2. Potentially an FTC violation (false advertising)

------------------------------------------------------------
OPTION A: REMOVE THE CLAIM (5 minutes) - DO THIS FIRST
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to: https://admin.shopify.com/store/shelzys-designs/themes/current/editor
2. Look for the announcement bar at the top of the page
3. Click on it to edit
4. Find the text "4.9★ • 500+ 5-Star Reviews"
5. CHANGE IT TO ONE OF THESE:

   "Free Shipping on Orders $50+ • Free Personalization"

   OR

   "Premium Sublimation Printing • Ships in 5-7 Days"

   OR

   "Handcrafted With Care • Permanent Sublimation Printing"

6. Click SAVE

------------------------------------------------------------
OPTION B: GET REAL REVIEWS (30 minutes setup, ongoing)
------------------------------------------------------------
