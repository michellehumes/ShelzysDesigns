<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>General Questions</h2>

<h3>Q: Is the personalization vinyl?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. All designs are created with true sublimation printing, which is permanent and won't peel or crack. The ink is infused directly into the bottle's coating, so your personalization becomes part of the bottle itself.</p>

<h3>Q: Will the design peel or fade?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. Unlike vinyl decals, sublimation printing is permanent. The ink is heat-pressed into the bottle's coating, so it won't peel, crack, or fade over time.</p>

<h3>Q: Are the bottles dishwasher safe?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We recommend hand washing to keep the finish looking its best for years. However, sublimation is far more durable than vinyl and won't peel in normal use. Many customers do put them in the dishwasher without issues, but hand washing ensures longevity.</p>

<h3>Q: How long do the bottles keep drinks cold or hot?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Our 20oz double-wall insulated bottles keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours.</p>

<h3>Q: Are the bottles BPA-free?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! All bottles are made from BPA-free stainless steel.</p>
