<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p>Ordering a personalized bottle from Shelzy's Designs is simple. Here's how it works from start to finish.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 1: Choose Your Bottle</h2>

<p>Browse our collections and pick your favorite bottle color and style. Whether you're shopping for a bridesmaid gift, a birthday present, or yourself—we've got options for every occasion.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 2: Add Your Personalization</h2>

<p>Enter the name exactly as you'd like it to appear. Choose your font style, text color, and any optional icons or design details. Don't worry—we'll make sure it looks perfectly balanced and beautifully centered.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 3: We Sublimate, Pack, and Ship</h2>

<p>Once you place your order, we get to work. Your design is printed using high-quality sublimation inks and heat-pressed directly into the bottle's coating (no vinyl stickers!). Each bottle is carefully inspected, beautifully packaged, and shipped to your door.</p>

<p><strong>Processing time:</strong> 3–5 business days<br>
<strong>Shipping time:</strong> 3–7 business days</p>

<h2>What is Sublimation?</h2>

<p>Sublimation is a printing process where ink is infused directly into the bottle's coating using heat and pressure. Unlike vinyl decals that sit on top of the surface (and eventually peel or crack), sublimation becomes part of the bottle itself.</p>

<p><strong>The result:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Smooth finish with no raised edges</li>
  <li>Won't peel, crack, or fade</li>
  <li>Dishwasher-safe (though we recommend hand washing for longevity)</li>
  <li>Looks professional and lasts for years</li>
</ul>
