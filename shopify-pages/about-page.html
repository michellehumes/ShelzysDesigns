<h1>Made With Care, One Bottle at a Time</h1>

<p>Shelzy's Designs was created around one simple idea: personalized gifts should feel special, not cheap. Every bottle is designed, sublimated, and packed with care so that when it arrives at your door, it feels like a gift—even if it's for yourself.</p>

<p>We don't use vinyl stickers or quick shortcuts. Your name is permanently infused into the bottle with high-quality sublimation printing for a smooth, long-lasting finish that looks as beautiful as the moment you unbox it.</p>

<p>What started as a passion for beautiful, functional design has grown into a business built on quality, attention to detail, and the belief that personalized gifts should last.</p>

<p>Whether you're a bride looking for the perfect bridesmaid proposal, a mom ordering bottles for your kids, or someone treating yourself to something special—we're here to create something you'll love.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for supporting Shelzy's Designs. Every order means the world to us.</strong></p>

<h2>How We Make Every Bottle</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You place your order with your custom details</li>
  <li>We design your personalization layout for perfect balance and spacing</li>
  <li>Your design is printed onto special sublimation paper</li>
  <li>The bottle is heated, and the ink is infused into the coating (this is sublimation!)</li>
  <li>We inspect every bottle for quality</li>
  <li>Your bottle is carefully packaged and shipped</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The result?</strong> A smooth, permanent finish that's part of the bottle—not stuck onto it.</p>
